Learning Skills
==========================
[**Project Website**](https://egalbally.github.io/learning_skills/)

This project contains the code required for a 7-DOF Panda robot to autonomously perform tasks involving 6 primitives: free space motion (FSM), make contact, align two surfaces, engage threads, screw, tighten. If a failure occurs, a user can intervene and haptically control the robot. This achieves two goals: (a) enables task completion, (b) allows us to collect data from the recovery strategies that can then be used to enhance the autonomous capabilities of the robot.
